 Sweep line algorithm

It can be applied in problems where we have intervals and you have to figure out an expression
[li,ri]
We will iterate on the x coordinate and try to maintain some important information in the data structure
-> if we put x or y value in a vector(zoro) we notice that between zoro[i] and zoro[i+1] no interval starts and no interval ends 

We only look 2n values
